            <p>As a project in Web and Internet Fundamentals semester one, we were tasked with taking a current movie poster and re-creating it using html. This entailed making all text highlightable and using css to make it look as close to the movie poster as we could. It took a lot of work, and searching to find the right fonts and logos, but I was very happy with the outcome of this assignment. The most time consuming part of this assignment was definitely using css and making sure everything was aligned and positioned properly... That, and downloading fonts and logos to match the poster. If you'd like to compare my version to the poster I was working with, you can follow the links below to compare for yourself.</p>

            <p>As a final assignment for my Web and Internet Fundamentals course we were required to create a website using the topic of an item that was created before the internet. Due to my extreme interest in the topic, I quickly chose Campbell's soup for my topic... Actually it was pretty much the first thing that came to mind. Regardless, using html and css, and a little bit of php, I made a website with some general details of what a website would have looked like for Campbell's soup. The biggest challenge with this assignment, again, was using css to arrange all the information and images in a fashion that would make the website flow. For the first full website I actually built from scratch, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Follow the link below to see the finished product!</p>

            <p>In my first year of college we were invited to create a project and have it presented in an "Innovation Showcase" where employers and fellow students could go and show off/see the work of the students. For the innovation showcase I chose to present my Arduino project I had been working on which used an Arduino, a Labyrinth game, two servos(motors) and a Nintendo Wii Nunchuk to play the game. The way it works is that whatever readings from the Nunchuk came through to the Arduino (values from either the Joystick or the Accelerometers) would then transmit to the servos telling them how far to turn in which direction. This was a fun way for users to control the game using the Wii Nunchuk, it took quite a lot of skill to play it this way, believe me.</p>
